## Application Flow Overview

This diagram presents the workflow of the Tarot Quote Analyzer App, illustrating the user's journey from starting the app to receiving a personalized analysis of a tarot-based quote. Additionally, the diagram outlines the technical stack and future deployment plans for the app.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Start**: The user initiates the application.
   
2. **Generate Lucky Number**: The user clicks a button to generate a random lucky number. This number is pivotal in determining the subsequent outputs of the app.

3. **Fetch Lucky Quote**: Leveraging the lucky number, the app fetches a quote that is considered to be auspicious or meaningful in the context of the user's generated number.

4. **Quote Analysis**: The obtained quote is then sent to the ChatGPT-4 API, which performs a detailed analysis, providing insights or an interpretation of the quote.

## Technical Stack

- **Front-End**: The app is built with React and TypeScript, offering a robust and type-safe user interface development.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS coupled with DaisyUI is used for a sleek, responsive design.
- **Back-End**: The application's server-side operations are managed by Next.js, providing server-rendered React components and additional back-end functionality.

## Development and Deployment Notes

- The creator intends to deploy the app to Firebase, acknowledging that the back-end requires further configuration.
- Continued development and enhancement of the app are planned for the summer period.
